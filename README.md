# Introduction

__DeColorful-Net.__ We propose a DeColorfulNet, which is based on a DML framework with a hierarchical
proxy-based loss and hierarchical bilateral grid network to mimic the expertsâ€™ retouching scheme

# Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.6
- PyTorch >= 1.0
- NVIDIA GPU + CUDA cuDNN

# Dataset

We propose the first aesthetic decolorization dataset which contains three different set retouched by experts.

## Dataset URL

Please download the dataset at [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pmvoaybrNvkAYeXa8bsx87t1Lr3Mfcb7?usp=drive_link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OQo5_NeiFza_un0R7FuP67-Bn6MHObVX?usp=drive_link) .

Then, you should change "dataset_path" in json file where you save the dataset. 

# Getting Started

Our DeColorful-Net consists of two steps.
1. Proxy-Generation
2. Decolorization 

Before train your model you should change some options with your settings which are listed in the form of json file.\

You can see json file with below command 
```
cd ./workspace/Expert/Trial1
```
## Installation


- Install python requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training Phase 1

```commandline
python train_step1.py --ws Expert --exp Multi_Encoder --args json 
```

ws: workspace\
exp: experience space\
args: which format to use options


## Training Phase 2

Make sure to change directory of pretrained model from training phase 1.

```commandline
python train_step2.py --ws Expert --exp Multi_Encoder --args json
```

## Inference

Make sure to change directory of pretrained model from training phase 1 & 2.\

```commandline
python test.py --ws Expert --exp Multi_Encoder --args json
```

## Pretrained Model
Our pretrained weights are released at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/192xs_tPeJmer-bnTFB1xng857xVfpxLn?usp=drive_link
Make sure all weights should be on the experience folder ex) workspace/Expert/Trial1/step1.pth.tar
